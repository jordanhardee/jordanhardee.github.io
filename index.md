## A Little Bit About Me

Saluton! Bonvenon al mia persona retejo! Welcome to my personal website!

Hello my name is Jordan Hardee. I am a 24 year old IT student who goes to the University of Cincinnati and is currently looking for an IT-related co-op. I am the Press Secretary of the Ohio Green Party and the General Secretary of the Warren County Green Party. I am an associate member of the Free Software Foundation, a member of Esperanto-USA, and The Planetary Society. I am very passionate about these things. I have written previously for _2600: The Hacker Quarterly_ under various pseudonyms and have anonymously contributed to a number of free software and peer-to-peer projects. I am currently doing research for a book I am writing on Albanian history in the 20th century. In my free time I also help install political notes on Richard Stallman's personal website.

Right now I'm trying to read all the major religious texts of the world and to get an understanding for the teachings and practices of all the major world religions (and some lesser known ones). I am planning on doing future programming related to brain-computer interfaces once I can afford the hardware as I believe writing such code as free (as in freedom) software is vitally important to the future. I am cautiously optimistic as to what the future holds. I try to be a good person as best as I can. I'm a bit of a polymath and tend to get obsessed with certain topics.

## Upcoming Book

I am currently doing research for my upcoming book on the history of cold-war Albania with a focus on human rights and religious freedom. I gave a talk on this subject in 2018 at the University of Cincinnati's Mediated Minds conference. My book tries to finish what Chris Moorey started in his impressive documentation of the religious persecution Orthodox Christian Albanians faced in his book _God_ _Among_ _The_ _Bunkers_ but with a focus on broader Albanian society and not merely on the experiences of Orthodox Christians. 

This book aims to place this period of Albanian history within the greater context of cold war politics and Albanian history, and in so doing acts as a political treatise that attempts to explain the 20th century phenomenon of Marxism-Leninism by going back to the roots of contemporary enlightenment political philosophy. It aims to adequately cover the broad social, economic and political background of Albania's distinct brand of Marxism-Leninism, how the official ideology functioned in practice, and the experienced reality of Hoxha's rule on the ground by ordinary people. I plan on traveling to Albania in the Summer of 2023 or 2024 to actually finish writing the book.

Here is a photo of me from 2018 with some of the books I own related to Albanian history. I'm probably one of the only Americans to own every book ever written by the Albanian dictator Enver Hoxha. They are quite rare and hard to come by.

## Green Party

I'm quite proud to have been elected the Press Secretary of the Ohio Green Party. The US Green Party has consistantly been decades ahead of its time and on the right side of history since it's inception. In addition to our ten key values, we fight for the abolition of the two-party system and the establishment of a genuine multi-party political system in the United States.
